# Simulation-and-Case-Study
You can see the codes related to the simulation and case study sections of the research in this section.

The file Simulation 1 corresponds to the section where the simulated data is repeated once, and the tree is split based on the variable Z1.

The file Simulation 2 and Case Study corresponds to the simulated data with 150 repetitions, which is taken directly from the original article.
