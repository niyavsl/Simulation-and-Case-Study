# Simulation-and-Case-Study
You can see the codes related to the simulation and case study sections of the research in this section.

The file "simulation palm tree" corresponds to the section where the simulated data is repeated once, and the tree is split based on the variable Z1.

The file "code-palmtree-adac" corresponds to the simulated data with 150 repetitions, which is taken directly from the original article.
